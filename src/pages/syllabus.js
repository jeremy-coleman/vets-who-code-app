                    Our curriculum is designed using the Agile Methodology with four-day sprints
                    dedicated to the subject. We do it in this manner based on the practice of how
                    veterans &quot;Train How You Fight&quot; in the military, so they should train
                    how they would work in a real software company. The primary language we will
                    focus on is JavaScript, due to its popularity in the job market, ease of
                    transition between Computer Science topics and real world application, and the
                    scope of industries we can introduce our veterans to, all while keeping language
                    proficiency at the forefront of the program. This way we can introduce Data
                    Visualization, Data Science, Cyber Security, and Internet of Things(IoT) to our
                    veterans, while continuing to have our troops grow in the area of JavaScript.
